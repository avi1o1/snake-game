The Sanke Game implemented in C Language [ College Project ]

Originally a "CS 61C Spring 2022, University of California, Berkley" Project (https://cs61c.org/fa23/projects/proj1/#conceptual-overview)

I took up the project as a voluntary exercise for practicing C, on recommendation of my professor, Mr. Girish Varma ( Assistant Professor at CSTAR, IIIT-H ).
The activity was a fun and educational experience which helped me strengthen my core concepts in the C language.

I learnt many good coding techniques and some not-so-very-good ways to waste an hour for not being able to find the memory leaks. 0-0
